# Guide: InsightEd Guide for Division Engineers

**Objective:** To equip Division Engineers with the strict technical protocols required for efficient infrastructure project tracking, secure account management, real-time monitoring, and reliable offline data synchronization during on-site field inspections.

> **Note:** This guide is strictly intended for the **Phase II of the InsightED Pilot Test**.

## Module 1: Pre-requisite - App Installation
**Objective:** Since InsightEd is a Progressive Web App (PWA) it operates directly from your mobile browser rather than App Store/Play Market. This ensures offline-readiness on all modern smartphones, which is critical for remote site visits.

1. **Open your Browser:** Open Google Chrome (Android) or Safari (iOS/iPhone).
2. **Navigate to the App Link:** Type the exact web address into your URL bar: `tinyurl.com/InsightEdV2`
3. **Wait for Load:** Allow the login screen to fully render.
4. **Initiate Installation:**
   - **For Android (Chrome):** Tap the **[Install App]** button on the bottom of the screen (or the three vertical dots menu at the top right, then select "Install App" or "Add to Home screen").
   - **For iOS (Safari):** Tap the **[Share]** icon (the square with an arrow pointing up at the bottom of the screen), scroll down, and tap **[Add to Home Screen]**.
5. **Confirm and Launch:** Confirm the installation prompt. Return to your phone's home screen and launch the app via the new **InsightEd** icon.

## Module 2: Registration & Account Creation
**Objective:** Establish your secure, official Division Engineer account securely tied to your designated Division.

1. **Access Registration:** From the login screen, tap the **[Create Account]** link at the bottom.
2. **Select Role:** Under "Registering As", tap the dropdown and select **[Division Engineer]**.
3. **Establish Division Linkage:**
   - Select your **Region**.
   - Select your specific **Division**.
4. **Enter Division Details:** Provide your Authorization Code: **`E5T8-B2W3`**.
5. **Enter Contact & Security Details:**
   - **Official DepEd Email:** Enter your official username prefix. The system forces the domain to be `@deped.gov.ph` for rigid compliance.
   - **Mobile Number:** Enter an active 11-digit mobile number starting with `09` (e.g., `09123456789`).
   - **Password:** Enter a strong password and repeat it in the **Confirm Password** field.
6. **Submit:** Tap the **[Register Account]** button. The system will create your dedicated Engineer profile.

## Module 3: Administrative Sign-In
**Objective:** Securely access your personal engineering dashboard.

1. **Launch the App:** Open the **InsightEd** app from your home screen.
2. **Access the Login Screen:** Enter your registered `@deped.gov.ph` email.
3. **Sign In:** Type your **Password** and tap the **[Sign In]** button.
4. **Grant App Permissions:** Upon first login, the app will prompt for device access. You must tap **[ALLOW]** for **Camera**, **Location**, and **Storage**.
> **Warning:** These permissions are absolutely non-negotiable. Location and Camera access are strictly required to attach verifiable geo-tagged photographic evidence to your infrastructure projects.

## Module 4: Infrastructure Tracking & Project Monitoring
**Objective:** Track the statuses, budgets, and accomplishment percentages of all active school building and repair projects within your Division.

### Utilizing the Engineer Dashboard:
1. **Overview Analytics:** Upon login, your active dashboard will display cards with high-level statistics:
   - **Total Allocation:** The aggregate budget (₱) of all your tracked projects.
   - **Projects:** The total count of active projects.
   - **Delayed Indicator (⚠️):** Instantly highlights any projects that have passed their target completion date but have not reached 100% accomplishment.
2. **Project Status Mix:** Evaluate your division's portfolio via the interactive Pie Chart detailing the split of *Completed*, *Ongoing*, *Under Procurement*, and *Delayed* assignments.
3. **Latest Remarks:** Check the scrolling timeline for recent updates or contractor notes from active sites.

### Appraising Individual Projects:
1. **Navigate to Projects:** Tap the **[Projects]** icon (Clipboard) in the bottom navigation menu.
2. **Search & Filter:** Use the top search bar to quickly query specific schools, project names, or InsightEd Project Codes (IPC).
3. **Evaluate Progress:** Projects are sorted by priority and display a real-time progress bar. A green bar indicates a completed project, while a blue gradient indicates ongoing efforts.

## Module 5: On-Site Inspections & Updating Real-Time Status
**Objective:** Record accurate, evidence-based project updates directly from the construction or repair site.

1. **Initiate an Update:** From the Project List, locate the designated project and tap the blue **[UPDATE]** button. *(Note: Completed projects will display a locked state).*
2. **Modify Core Project Metrics:** 
   - Ensure the **Status** is accurate (*Ongoing, For Final Inspection, Completed, etc.*).
   - Update the **Accomplishment Percentage** slider or input box to reflect real-life milestones.
   - If the project is finished, ensure you declare the **Actual Completion Date**.
3. **Upload Mandatory Photographic Proof:** COA requirements mandate visual evidence for all progress updates. Scroll down to the image attachment section within the update modal.
   - Tap the **Camera Icon** to take a live photo of the site.
   - Tap the **Image/Gallery Icon** to upload an existing high-quality photo from your device's storage.
   - **Important: Categorize your evidence:** 
     - **Internal Photos:** Submit photos depicting the interior construction logic (e.g., roofing structural integrity, ceiling works, classroom finishings, electrical rough-ins).
     - **External Photos:** Submit photos proving the exterior stage of the infrastructure (e.g., foundational civil works, structural framing, exterior painting, or the complete facade).
4. **Save Your Changes:** Review all inputs. Once verified, tap **[Save]**. 
> **Important Rule:** You cannot mark a project as **[Completed]** without supplying a formal Actual Completion Date. Furthermore, progress updates without appropriately categorized photographic evidence may be rejected.

## Module 6: Offline Protocol for Remote Field Sites
**Objective:** Defend against data loss when inspecting schools or infrastructure sites with zero or limited network connectivity.

1. **Work Offline Seamlessly:** InsightEd automatically caches your Division's project roster. If you arrive at a mountain or island site with no signal, you can still view details and submit structural updates.
2. **Perform Your Inspection:** Tap the **[UPDATE]** button, change the progress percentages, and take your verification photos just as you normally would.
3. **Local Caching:** When you hit **[Save]**, the app will notify you: *"⚠️ Offline: Changes cached to Sync Center"*. Your updates, including heavy image payloads, are safely encrypted on your phone.
4. **Execute Data Sync:** Once you arrive at the Division Office or an area with a stable mobile network, tap the **[Sync]** icon on the bottom navigation.
5. **Transmit Updates:** Review the pending outbox items and tap **[Sync All]**. The app will automatically upload your data and compress your photos for swift transmission. Keep the app open until the success message appears.

## Module 7: Maintenance & Troubleshooting
**Objective:** Resolve technical hiccups and keep the platform optimized.

1. **App Updates:** Look for the pulsing green **"Update Available"** prompt on your dashboard. When prompted, tap **[Reload Now]** to install vital security patches or new feature deployments over-the-air.
2. **Clear Cache:** If project lists appear duplicated or fail to load correctly, navigate to your **[Profile]** menu and execute the **[Clear Cache]** function to refresh your memory without deleting pending outbox drafts.
3. **Data Parity:** Ensure you launch the application at least once while connected to a strong Wi-fi network before heading out to remote sites to ensure your local cache is populated with the most recent contractor updates.
