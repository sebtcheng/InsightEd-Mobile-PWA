## Module 5: Understanding Your Data Health Score
**Objective:** Comprehend the automated scoring algorithm and apply strategies to ensure an 'Excellent' 100% or a 'Good' 90% rating.

The InsightEd platform features an advanced Data Health and Fraud Detection engine that computationally evaluates your submissions every night. Every school starts with a base score of **100 points**. 

### How Points Are Deducted:
1. **Critical Missing Data (-25 points per issue):**
   - Reporting enrollment without reporting corresponding teachers, classrooms, or toilets.
   - Forgetting to breakdown teacher experience or class section details.
2. **Data Consistency Mismatches (-25 points per issue):**
   - Headcounts don't align (e.g., Total teaching personnel vs. specialized teachers, or student enrollment vs. organized class sections).
   - Unrealistic ratios (e.g., an average class size exceeding 65 students or falling below 15 students).
3. **Statistical Outliers (-10 to -30 points):**
   - The system flags abnormal ratios against regional standards (e.g., Pupil-to-Teacher, Pupil-to-Classroom, Pupil-to-Toilet, Pupil-to-Furniture, Pupil-to-Seat). 
4. **Multivariate Inconsistencies (-20 points):**
   - The algorithm detects highly unusual combinations of enrollment and resources that contradict typical school profiles.

### Scoring Tiers & Validation:
- **100 (Excellent):** Perfect submission. No issues detected.
- **90-99 (Good):** Minor statistical outliers.
- **50-89 (Fair):** Significant missing data or multiple inconsistencies.
- **<50 (Critical):** Immediate attention required.

### Strategies for a Perfect 100% Score:
1. **Never Leave Zeros on Critical Resources:** If your school has enrolled learners, zero counts for teachers, classrooms, or toilets will trigger massive penalties. 
2. **Match Your Sub-Totals:** Always double-check that your detailed breakdowns (like teacher experience or grade-level sections) sum up exactly to the total counts provided.
3. **Declare Temporary Facilities:** If your enrollment is high but classrooms are low, ensure you declare temporary learning spaces or shifting modalities to mathematically justify the high Pupil-to-Classroom Ratio.
4. **Complete the Specialization Form:** Ensure that at least 50% of your total reported teachers are registered with a defined specialization and teaching load.

## Module 6: Offline Guide & Data Synchronization
**Objective:** Safeguard your data during field inspections with limited internet connectivity.

1. **Work Offline Confidently:** The InsightEd app utilizes a local-first architecture. If you lose internet connection while filling out forms, continue working. A banner stating **"📵 Offline - Read Only"** may appear for some live validations, but your typed inputs are securely saved to your local cache.
2. **Monitor Pending Forms:** Forms completed without an internet connection are safely held in the app's internal memory queue.
3. **Execute the Sync Protocol:** Once you return to an area with a stable Wi-Fi or cellular data connection, navigate to the **[Sync]** dashboard via the bottom navigation menu.
4. **Initiate Transfer:** Check the list of pending items. Tap the **[Manual Sync]** or **[Sync All]** button to transmit your encrypted local data to the central database. Wait until you see a success confirmation notification on the screen.
> **CRITICAL WARNING:** Never log out of your account, clear the app's internal storage/cache, or uninstall the InsightEd app while you have forms pending sync. Doing so will result in the permanent, irrecoverable loss of that data.

---

## Module 7: Maintenance & Troubleshooting
**Objective:** Maintain optimal application performance and resolve common glitches without risking data loss.

1. **Resolve UI Glitches:** If the app freezes, form templates appear blank, or drop-down menus fail to load, navigate to your **[Settings]** or **[Profile]** menu using the bottom navigation bar.
2. **Clear Cache/Troubleshoot:** Tap the **[Troubleshoot]** or **[Clear Cache]** button. This safely refreshes the underlying form schemas and clears temporary memory without deleting your local drafts or pending sync data.
3. **Ensure Protocol Compliance:** Every Monday morning, navigate to the same **[Settings]** menu.
4. **Check for Updates:** Tap **[Check for Updates]**.
> **Pro-Tip:** Performing this step weekly guarantees your app is equipped with the latest DepEd-mandated reporting templates, form options, bug fixes, and vital security patches for the week ahead.
